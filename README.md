# Movie Recommender: Code-Along
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/yishuen/meetup-movie-recommender/master)

A code-along Jupyter notebook for the Flatiron School Meetup, "The Science Behind Netflix Recommendations: Workshop", presented on:
- June 5, 2019
- October 21, 2019

[Slides](https://github.com/yishuen/meetup-movie-recommender/blob/master/Science-of-Netflix.pdf)

The dataset used is **The Movies Dataset** found on Kaggle, specifically from the file *ratings_small.csv*: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset

## Accessing the Code:

The easiest way to see the code is by clicking here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/yishuen/meetup-movie-recommender/master)

If you're reading the code in Binder, you won't be able to run `codealong`, but you can view `codealong-clean`.

If you do want to run the code on your own, download Jupyter Notebook and run these lines in your terminal:

 1. `git clone https://github.com/yishuen/meetup-movie-recommender.git`
 2. `cd meetup-movie-recommender`
 3. `jupyter notebook`


## Additional Readings and Resources:

I wrote a couple posts on Medium about recommendation engines: https://medium.com/@yishuen
- [A Primer to Recommendation Engines](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-primer-to-recommendation-engines-49bd12ed849f)
- [Collaborative Filtering on Utility Matrices](https://towardsdatascience.com/math-for-data-science-collaborative-filtering-on-utility-matrices-e62fa9badaab)

A great book on big data. My favorite chapter is Chapter 9, and I highly *recommend* it if you want to understand how SVD works using gradient descent + Alternating Least Squares.

A couple really good podcast episodes that got me started with recommendation engines:
- Data Skeptic: http://dataskeptic.libsyn.com/recommender-systems-live-from-farcon-2017
- Linear Digressions: http://lineardigressions.com/episodes/2017/6/25/factorization-machines
